A powerful Pro extension to Admin Hero that unlocks real‑time autosave, a draggable modal with position memory, fullscreen mode, persistent notes across navigation, and more.

== Description ==
Admin Hero Pro builds on the free core plugin by adding:
* **Autosave Notes:** Continuously saves your note content as you type (and on close), with visual “autosaved” feedback.
* **Persistence Mode:** Remembers whether the modal was open (and its position/fullscreen state) across page loads and navigation.
* **Dragging Modal:** Lets you click-and-drag the modal header to reposition it, remembers that position, and offers a “reset” link.
* **Floater (Dashboard):** Adds a convenient and persistent floating button to access your Hero from anywhere in the dashboard.
* **Frontend Mode:** Brings all the same functionality to your site’s front end.

Perfect for power users and agencies who need an advanced, always‑available note system directly inside WordPress.

== Installation ==
1. Purchase **Admin Hero Pro** from the link above and download `admin-hero-pro.zip`.
2. In your WP dashboard, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
3. Choose `admin-hero-pro.zip` and click **Install Now**.
4. Enter your license key under **Settings → Admin Hero Pro** to activate and enable automatic updates.

== Usage ==
1. After activation, Pro feature toggles appear under **Settings** (gear icon).
2. Configure which Pro features you want (autosave, fullscreen, draggable modal, etc.).
3. Use the logo button in the admin bar to open your Hero modal.
4. All changes are autosaved (if enabled), and your notes persist exactly how you left them.
5. Enjoy the extended Info panel (info icon).
